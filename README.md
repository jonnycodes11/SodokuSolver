Sudoku Solver
Description
This Python script implements a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. It utilizes the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the Sudoku board and solve it visually. The board is represented as a 9x9 grid where users can see the progress of the solution in real-time.

Features
Visual representation of Sudoku board using Tkinter.
Interactive solving process with color-coded cell updates.
Solves Sudoku puzzles with the backtracking algorithm.
Allows users to see step-by-step solving progress.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
Usage
Clone or download the repository.

Run the script using Python.

bash
Copy code
python sudoku_solver.py
A GUI window will appear displaying the Sudoku board.

Click the "Solve Sudoku" button to start solving the puzzle. The solver will attempt to fill in the board and visually update the cells as it progresses.

Code Explanation
print_board(board): Prints the Sudoku board to the console in a readable format.
is_number_in_row(board, number, row): Checks if a number is present in a specific row.
is_number_in_column(board, number, column): Checks if a number is present in a specific column.
is_number_in_box(board, number, row, column): Checks if a number is present in the 3x3 box that contains the cell.
is_valid_placement(board, number, row, column): Determines if a number can be placed in a specific cell without violating Sudoku rules.
solve_board(board): Recursively solves the Sudoku board using backtracking.
solve_sudoku(): Starts the solving process and updates the GUI.
update_gui(): Updates the GUI to reflect the current state of the board.
update_cell(row, col, color): Changes the background color of a specific cell in the GUI.
Example
The script initializes a Sudoku board with a predefined puzzle and solves it upon clicking the "Solve Sudoku" button. The cells will change color to indicate the solving process.
